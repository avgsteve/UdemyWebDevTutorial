斜體字 emphasis <em> vs 斜體 <i>的 標籤用法
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em#%3Ci%3E_vs._%3Cem%3E
New developers are often confused at seeing multiple elements that produce similar results. <em> and <i> are a common example, since they both italicize text. What's the difference? Which should you use?

By default, the visual result is the same. However, the semantic meaning is different. The <em> element represents stress emphasis of its contents, while the <i> element represents text that is set off from the normal prose, such a foreign word, fictional character thoughts, or when the text refers to the definition of a word instead of representing its semantic meaning. (The title of a work, such as the name of a book or movie, should use <cite>.)

This means the right one to use depends on the situation. Neither is for purely decorational purposes, that's what CSS styling is for.

An example for <em> could be: "Just do it already!", or: "We had to do something about it". A person or software reading the text would pronounce the words in italics with an emphasis, using verbal stress.

An example for <i> could be: "The Queen Mary sailed last night". Here, there is no added emphasis or importance on the word "Queen Mary". It is merely indicated that the object in question is not a queen named Mary, but a ship named Queen Mary. Another example for <i> could be: "The word the is an article".




列表 List的用法

UL unordered list
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul

The <ul> element is for grouping a collection of items that do not have a numerical ordering, and their order in the list is meaningless. Typically, unordered-list items are displayed with a bullet, which can be of several forms, like a dot, a circle or a squared. The bullet style is not defined in the HTML description of the page, but in its associated CSS, using the list-style-type property.


<ul>
    <li>Milk</li>
    <li>Cheese
        <ul>
            <li>Blue cheese</li>
            <li>Feta</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

  -Milk
  -Cheese
    -Blue cheese
    -Feta
